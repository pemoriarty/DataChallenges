    "#### Goal: Determine the cause of the drop in user engagement\n",
    "##### Chart shows drop in weekly active users beginning week of Aug. 1- why did this occur?\n",
    "#### Potential reasons:\n",
    "##### 1. Certain companies stopped using Yammer\n",
    "#####     -  test by: if number of active accounts decreased, was this only in certain companies?\n",
    "##### 2. Engagement in certain products was reduced\n",
    "#####    -  Did uses of just certain products go down?\n",
    "##### 3.  Reduction in retention\n",
    "#####    -  test by: did number of active acounts decrease?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions to answer:\n",
    "##### - Do the answers to any of your original hypotheses lead you to further questions?\n",
    "##### - If so, what are they and how will you test them?\n",
    "##### - If they are questions that you canâ€™t answer using data alone, how would you go about answering them (hypothetically, assuming you actually worked at this company)?\n",
    "##### - What seems like the most likely cause of the engagement dip?\n",
    "##### - What, if anything, should the company do in response?"
